        Many people think that video games are bad or cause violent tendencies, but that's not really the case. According to <a href = "https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-video-games-parenting-20171110-story.html">this article by LA Times</a>, 
        video games are addicting, but there isn't any substantial evidence stating that they may cause violent behavior; it's a way of blowing off steam when stressed. 
        <a href = "https://www.raisesmartkid.com/3-to-6-years-old/4-articles/34-the-good-and-bad-effects-of-video-games">Another article </a>states that video games can be both good and bad. It can change the brain in the same ways that playing an instrument or learning to read
        does. However, in <a href =  "https://www.neurocorecenters.com/blog/are-video-games-actually-bad-for-you">this article</a>, it states that although video games host a plethora of benefits to the brain, it's not a risk-free hobby. 
        Excessive video game play isn't good for your physical health and can hinder social skills. It's important to balance video games and physical socializing. Overall, it's important to play video games in moderation, like any other addictive activities (i.e. drugs, sports, gambling, sex, shopping, binge eating, etc.). Otherwise, video games can be a fun way to spend your time.
